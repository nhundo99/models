Session 4: DCF Structure and Discount Rate first Steps

The discount rate is a lot less important than the actual estimation of the cashflow.

Differ between Equity vs Firm discount rate
correct currency
nominal vs real

Risk adjusted cost of Equity = fisk free rate + relative risk of company * equity risk premium

We concentrate on the risk free rate in session 4

tangent on risk:
    estimation uncertainty vs economic uncertainty
    micro uncertainty vs macro  uncertainty
        macro should be included in the discount rate
            when we have a somewhat diversed portfolio
    discrete uncertainty vs continuous uncertainty
    not all risk counts

Market risk Models:
    CAPM
    APM
    Multifacto
    Proxy

Risk Free Rate:
    no default Risk
    no reinvestment risk
    time horizon matters
    currencies matters
    not all government securities are riskfree

    for usd best is to use 10-year T bond rate to easily compare to 10-year bond of company
    for real (instead of nominal) valuation the TIPs (inflatioin-indexed treasury) is better
        for these two bonds we assume default free 

    for euro
        use the treasury bond rate from the country with the lowest rate in the euro zon
            this is because we assume no default risk here
            the adjustment for the default risk will be made later but NOT IN THE RISK FREE RATE

    we can just take the 10-year bond rating if the country has a triple A rating

    for riskier currencies
        we can subtract a defaut spread to the 10-year bond rate to get a risk free rate (without the default risk) 

    how to come up with the default spread
        soverign bonds denominated in USD issued by sovereign
            ds = emrg govt bond rate in usd - us T-bond rate with same maturity
        sovereign CDS market
            ds = sovereign cds spread (adjust with us spread)
        sovereign-rating based spread

        does not matter which one we choose, just stay consistent with it
